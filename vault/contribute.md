# Contribute

Open AWS is a **compilation** of current open source guides available on AWS which makes contributing to this project a little different than contributing to a normal guide. 

Open AWS is formatted and published using [Dendron](https://dendron.so), an open source knowledge management platform that helps people create, build, and collaborate on knowledge. 

Dendron makes it possible to curate and remix information from existing sources into what we call [catalogues](TODO)

The guide that you see here is generated from the [open-aws-catalogue](TODO). To add content from additional sources, you can use the following stps:
- see if the guide covers something that is already on our [[roadmap]]
    - if yes, check the corresponding issue to see if anyone has started working on the pod
        - if no one has claimed the pod, feel free to claim it by posting in the issue
        - once you have finished with the pod, publish it to github and update the issue with the output of running your pod
    - if no, send us a [pod request](TODO)
